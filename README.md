# 06-Weather Dashboard using Server-Side APIs:

## Task

This week's challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS alongside the use of [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
✓ WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
✓ WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
✓ WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
✓ WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
✓ WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
